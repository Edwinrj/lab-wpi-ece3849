## Importing External Libraries

> [!NOTE] 
> Integrate pre-built libraries that simplify working with peripherals and timing on the TM4C1294XL LaunchPad.

We have prepared several libraries to help you use the board peripherals more easily and modularly. These libraries allow you to write cleaner code without having to configure all registers manually.

---

### Available Libraries

| Library | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **buttonsDriver** | Manages hardware buttons with **debouncing**, and supports **click**, **double click**, and **long press** callbacks. |
| **display** | Includes Texas Instruments drivers for the **Crystalfontz 128√ó128 ST7735 LCD** display. |
| **timerLib** | Initializes a **hardware timer** to control time-based events without using SysTick. Ideal for periodic tasks. |
| **elapsedTime** | Works with `timerLib` to measure elapsed time between events easily using one timer source. |
| **HAL_TM4C1294XL** | Defines pin names and mappings for the TM4C1294XL to make code clearer and portable. |
| **joystickDriver** | Simplifies joystick input: provides **Cartesian** and **polar coordinates**, plus callbacks for directional events (N, S, E, W). |
| **PLL** | Calculates the **actual MCU frequency** after PLL configuration so timing values stay accurate. |

### Folder Organization

When you open your workspace, you will find two main folders:

<FileTree>
- Lab_x
  - Lab_x_workspace
    - ...
  - libraries
    - buttonsDriver
      - ...
    - display
      - ...
    - timerLib
      - ...
    - elapsedTime 
      - ...
    - HAL_TM4C1294XL
      - ...
    - joystickDriver
      - ...
    - PLL
      - ...
</FileTree> 


> [!TIP]
> The **libraries** folder should always remain **outside** your project workspace folder. Keep all library files together in this single location.

---

### Importing the Libraries into Code Composer Studio

1. Open your CCS workspace.
2. **Drag the entire `libraries` folder** into the CCS Project Explorer panel.

    <br />
  <sub><span style="color:#4ec9b0; font-weight:bold;">Drag the <code>libraries</code> folder into Code Composer Studio</span></sub>
</p>

3. When the import dialog appears, choose:
   - ‚úÖ **Link to files and recreate folder structure with virtual folders**
   - ‚úÖ **Create link location relative to PROJECT_LOC**

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJA97qNRgg.png" alt="CCS link to files options" width="480" style="border-radius:10px; box-shadow:0 0 10px #66ccff99;" />
    <br />
  <sub><span style="color:#3399ff; font-weight:bold;">Always link files relative to PROJECT_LOC</span></sub>
</p>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ‚ö†Ô∏è This step is **crucial**. Always link libraries this way when adding them to any project. Do **not** copy them into the project directly.

4. CCS will then ask if you want to **add include paths automatically**. Select:
   - ‚úÖ **Do this for all header files currently being added**
   - ‚úÖ **Yes**

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy0aQ9NClx.png" alt="Include path confirmation" width="480" style="border-radius:10px; box-shadow:0 0 10px #00ffff66;" />
    <br />
  <sub><span style="color:#4ec9b0; font-weight:bold;">Confirm include path for all header files</span></sub>
</p>

---

### Verify Project Structure

After importing, your project should look like this:

<p align="center"><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk-lE9EAge.png" alt="Project structure after importing libraries" width="200" style="border-radius:10px; box-shadow:0 0 10px #00ffff66;"/>
  <br />
  <sub><span style="color:#4ec9b0; font-weight:bold;">Project structure with linked <code>libraries</code> folder</span></sub>
</p>

---

### Verify Include Paths

To confirm everything is correctly linked:
1. Right-click your project ‚Üí **Properties**
2. Navigate to:
   ```
   Build ‚Üí ARM Compiler ‚Üí Include Options
   ```
3. You should see entries similar to:
   ```
   ${PROJECT_LOC}/libraries/buttonsDriver
   ${PROJECT_LOC}/libraries/display
   ${PROJECT_LOC}/libraries/timerLib
   ${PROJECT_LOC}/libraries/elapsedTime
   ${PROJECT_LOC}/libraries/HAL_TM4C1294XL
   ${PROJECT_LOC}/libraries/joystickDriver
   ${PROJECT_LOC}/libraries/PLL
   ```
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJp7E5VRex.png" alt="Verify include paths in CCS" width="600" style="border-radius:10px; box-shadow:0 0 10px #00ffff66;" />
   <br />
    <sub><span style="color:#4ec9b0; font-weight:bold;">Include paths confirmation in CCS project properties</span></sub>
</p>

> [!TIP]
> üí° If any path is missing, click **Add...**, navigate to your `libraries` folder, and ensure the path is relative to `${PROJECT_LOC}`.

---

‚úÖ Once all libraries are linked and visible in Project Explorer, you can include them in your code normally:

```c
#include "buttonDriver.h"
#include "timerLib.h"
#include "elapsedTime.h"
#include "HAL_TM4C1294XL.h"
```

You are now ready to use modular drivers and utilities for your Lab development!
