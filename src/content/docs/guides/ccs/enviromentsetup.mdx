> ⚙️ **This procedure must always be done when using university lab computers.**  
> These systems reset their configurations every time you log out, so you must reconfigure the environment each session.

### Open the Compiler Preferences

1. In Code Composer Studio, go to:
   ```
   Window → Preferences → Code Composer Studio → Build → Compilers
   ```
2. You will see a list of available compiler paths.

### Add the TivaWare Path

1. Click **Add...** and navigate to:
   ```
   C:\ti\TivaWare_C_Series-2.2.0.295
   ```
2. Select the folder and click **OK**.
3. Then click **Refresh** — you should now see the **TivaWare** compiler resources appear in the list.

### Verify Environment Variable

Ensure that the environment variable `SW_ROOT` is defined as `String` and points to:
```bash
C:\ti\TivaWare_C_Series-2.2.0.295
```
You can verify or edit this under: 
```
Window → Preferences → Code Composer Studio → Build → Variables
```
This variable is required by many projects to locate shared driver and graphics libraries.

### Verify Perspective

1. In the top menu, go to:
   ```
   Window → Perspective → Other...
   ```
2. Select **CCS Edit** to switch to the correct perspective.
3. If your layout ever becomes misconfigured, reset it via:
   ```
   Window → Perspective → Reset Perspective
   ```

Once this configuration is complete, your environment is ready to build and debug projects using TivaWare support libraries.
