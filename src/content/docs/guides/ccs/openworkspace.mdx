## Workspace Setup 
<Aside type="note" title="Important">
Every time you use a **lab computer**, you must reconfigure the CCS environment. These computers reset to default settings each time you log out.
</Aside>

### Download the Workspace

Download the provided workspace archive (link provided on every lab).  
Once downloaded, **extract** the folder to a location you can easily find, for example:
```bash
C:\Users\<your_username>\Documents\labx
```

#### Folder Organization
When you open your workspace, you will find two main folders:
<FileTree>
- Lab_x
  - Lab_x_workspace
    - ...
  - Libraries
    - ...
</FileTree>


> [!tip]
> The **libraries** folder should always remain **outside** your project workspace folder. Keep all library files together in this single location.

### Open Workspace in CCS

When you launch Code Composer Studio, a window will appear asking you to select a **workspace**:

  <br />
  <sub>Workspace selection window at startup</sub>
</p>

In this dialog:
1. Click **Browse...**  and navigate to the folder where you extracted the workspace.
2. Select the extracted workspace directory.
3. Click **Launch**.
---
After launching, CCS will open using the provided workspace configuration.  
Inside that workspace, you should see a **template project folder** "LabX" where you will develop your labs.

> [!TIP]
> If CCS opens an empty workspace, make sure you selected the **correct folder** — it should contain the `.metadata` subfolder and your lab project files.


### Verifying Project Properties

> [!warning]
> Ensure your project is configured for the correct device and connection interface before building.

When working in Code Composer Studio, it’s important to confirm that your project is set up for the **correct microcontroller and debug interface**.

---

### Open Project Properties

1. In the **Project Explorer**, right-click your project (e.g., `ece3849_lab0`) and select:
   ```
   Properties
   ```
2. Go to the following menu:
   ```
   General → Project
   ```

---

### Verify Device and Connection

Make sure the settings match the following:

- **Device:** `Tiva TM4C1294NCPDT`
- **Connection:** `Stellaris In-Circuit Debug Interface`

  <br/>
  <sub><span style="color:#4ec9b0; font-weight:bold;">Correct project configuration for TM4C1294NCPDT and Stellaris interface</span></sub>
</p>

> [!TIP]
> These settings ensure that CCS can correctly compile and flash your program to the TM4C1294XL LaunchPad. If they don’t match, select the correct options and click **Apply and Close**.
