## Introduction

<Aside type="note" title="Purpose">
This lab serves as an introductory tutorial to the **embedded system platform** and **software development environment** that will be used throughout this course. It also provides a review of key concepts from **ECE3849**, helping you become familiar with both the hardware and software tools that will be used in subsequent labs.
</Aside>

In this lab, you will:
- Set up your development environment using **Code Composer Studio (CCS)**
- Explore the **TM4C1294XL LaunchPad** and **BOOSTXL-EDUMKII BoosterPack** hardware
- Import and run a **starter stopwatch project** to verify your environment setup
- Learn how to write modular embedded programs using **C/C++** and **TI's driver libraries**

<Aside type="caution" title="Lab Requirements"></Aside>
To complete each lab in this course, you must:
<Steps>

1. **Submit your source code** for the lab
2. **Demonstrate your project** in operation to one of the course staff (TA or tutor)  
3. Receive a **sign-off** after successful demonstration
</Steps>

You will be graded based on the completion of the required steps and correct functionality.  
Late submissions will receive a **20% penalty** unless otherwise specified by your instructor.
