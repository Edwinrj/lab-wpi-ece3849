## Introduction

<Aside type="note" title="Purpose">
This lab serves as an introductory tutorial to the **embedded system platform** and **software development environment** that will be used throughout this course. It also provides a review of key concepts from **ECE3849**, helping you become familiar with both the hardware and software tools that will be used in subsequent labs.
</Aside>

In this lab, you will:
- Set up your development environment using **Code Composer Studio (CCS)**
- Explore the **TM4C1294XL LaunchPad** and **BOOSTXL-EDUMKII BoosterPack** hardware
- Import and run a **starter stopwatch project** to verify your environment setup
- Learn how to write modular embedded programs using **C/C++** and **TI's driver libraries**

<Aside type="caution" title="Lab Requirements"></Aside>
To complete each lab in this course, you must:
<Steps>

1. **Submit your source code** for the lab
2. **Demonstrate your project** in operation to one of the course staff (TA or tutor)  
3. Receive a **sign-off** after successful demonstration
</Steps>

You will be graded based on the completion of the required steps and correct functionality.  
Late submissions will receive a **20% penalty** unless otherwise specified by your instructor.

| Step | Description | Max Points | Score |
|:-----|:-------------|:-----------:|:------:|
| 1 | Compile and flash the **starter stopwatch example** (verify environment) | 10 |   |
| 2 | Extend the stopwatch to display **HH:MM:SS:MS** format | 20 |   |
| 3 | Implement physical buttons **S1 → Play/Pause** and **S2 → Reset** | 35 |   |
| 4 | Add on-screen buttons with feedback and state text (**Running / Stopped**) | 15 |   |
| 5 | **Source Code** — Organization, readability, and modular structure | 20 |   |
|   | **Total** | **100** |   |

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will have accomplished:

* Install software: **Code Composer Studio (CCS)** and **Free-RTOS**
* Set up a CCS project for the EK‑TM4C1294XL + BoosterPack
* Output to the 128×128 LCD display
* Configure general purpose timers and interrupts
* Read and debounce user buttons
* Understand how to import libraries

<Aside type="tip" title="Connection Note">
In this lab, we will use the **BoosterPack 1** position on the EK‑TM4C1294XL LaunchPad.
This corresponds to the **outer header connectors (J1, J2, J3, and J4)**. Make sure the pins are aligned correctly as shown below.
